## Issue Summary:

**Duration:** 
> The outage occurred from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM (UTC) on October 15, 2022.

**Impact:**
>  The outage affected our web application's login and authentication service.
> Approximately 30% of our users experienced login failures or slow login times during the incident.

**Root Cause:**
> The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

## Timeline:

* 3:00 PM: The issue was detected when our monitoring system triggered alerts for increased login failure rates.
* 3:10 PM: The incident was escalated to the DevOps team as engineers noticed a spike in error logs related to authentication.
* 3:20 PM: DevOps began investigating the issue, suspecting a database problem and initiated a failover to a backup database.
* 3:45 PM: With no improvement, the incident was escalated to the Network team, suspecting network latency issues.
* 4:00 PM: Network engineers investigated the network infrastructure but found no significant issues.
* 4:30 PM: In parallel, the Security team was engaged, suspecting an attack.
* 5:00 PM: After extensive analysis, it was discovered that the load balancer was misconfigured, causing uneven distribution of traffic and slow response times.
* 5:30 PM: The misconfiguration was corrected, and login services were restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**
> The root cause was a misconfiguration in the load balancer's algorithm, causing it to route traffic unevenly. Some application servers were overloaded while others were underutilized, resulting in slow login times and failures.

**Resolution:**
> The misconfiguration in the load balancer was corrected by adjusting the algorithm settings to evenly distribute incoming traffic among application servers. Additionally, monitoring was improved to detect similar issues early on.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Corrective Measures:**

1. Implement more accurate monitoring and alerting systems to promptly detect load balancer misconfigurations.
2. Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations to identify and rectify any other potential misconfigurations.
3. Enhance communication and escalation procedures to ensure faster resolution and collaboration among teams.

**Preventative Measures:**

1. Implement automated load balancer configuration validation to prevent future misconfigurations.
2. Schedule regular load balancer audits and reviews to proactively identify and address issues.
3. Enhance employee training on load balancer management to minimize human error.

This postmortem serves as a valuable lesson in the importance of monitoring, timely incident escalation, and configuration management. By implementing the corrective and preventative measures mentioned above, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the continued reliability of our services.
